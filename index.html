            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Davide, also known as Dadda. I'm a high school student with a deep passion for programming and technology. Currently, I'm in my third year at a scientific high school, where I specialize in rigorous subjects like mathematics, physics, and science. My academic journey has been driven by a curiosity to understand how things work at a fundamental level, which naturally led me to the world of coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my school studies, I'm enrolled in a computer engineering course, which has allowed me to expand my knowledge of various programming languages and tools. This course has been instrumental in honing my skills, particularly in web development, where I frequently work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy the creative process of building websites, bringing ideas to life through code.
            </p>
            <p>
                While web development is my primary focus, I also have a solid grounding in software development, particularly in Java and Python. These languages have given me a strong foundation in computational thinking and problem-solving, enabling me to tackle complex challenges with confidence. I'm always eager to learn more and push the boundaries of what I can create with code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond programming, I am fluent in both Italian and English, the latter of which I've mastered to a C1 level, certified by <a href="https://www.trinitycollege.it/">Trinity College London</a>. My proficiency in English has opened up countless opportunities for me to engage with global communities and access a wealth of resources. Additionally, I speak Spanish at a B2 level, thanks to my studies at the <a href="https://milan.cervantes.es/it/diplomi_spagnolo/info_dele_italiano.htm">Cervantes Institute</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:davideviscuso@icloud.com">davideviscuso@icloud.com</a>.
